          <h2>What is TASK L3C?</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
          TASK L3C is a public-benefit organization created to strengthen Japan’s
          disaster readiness before the next major event by connecting international
          supporters with frontline Japanese NGOs and NPOs. We help build
          preparedness, capability, and long-term resilience where it is needed most.
        </p>
        <p>
          We focus on the “missing layer” between everyday operations and emergency
          response—supporting planning, training, and funding ahead of time so
          Japanese organizations are not starting from zero when the worst happens.

      <!-- WHY -->

          <h2>Why TASK L3C exists</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
          Japan experiences major disasters with predictable frequency, yet frontline
          NGOs and NPOs are often forced to respond without pre-disaster funding,
          mutual support, or international preparation already in place. When a
          crisis strikes, Japan must respond immediately—often without recognized
          resources or operational support ready to go.
        </p>
        <p>
          TASK L3C exists to change this pattern by strengthening readiness before
          the next event and by connecting committed supporters to the organizations
          closest to communities at risk.
