        <p>
          TASK L3C is building a future where Japan’s disaster response does not start from zero.
          Readiness is already active long before an earthquake, tsunami, or other major event.

          <h2>What we learned in 2011</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
          During the 2011 Tohoku disaster, Japan’s general public and NGO/NPO community moved first.
          The response was powerful — but it also revealed a recurring problem: trusted organizations
          were forced to improvise without pre‑disaster resources and coordination already in place.
        </p>
        <p>
          TASK L3C was created from that lesson. The gap is not Japan’s will or capability during a crisis.
          The gap is what happens beforehand — the readiness layer that should already connect funding,
          roles, and support networks.

          <div class="eyebrow">What TASK is</div>
          <h2>The missing layer</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
          TASK is not a rapid‑response charity. We strengthen the layer that must exist <em>before</em>
          a disaster so that response and recovery work can begin immediately with support ready to go.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Every organization has a primary mission.</strong> TASK L3C supports readiness in ways
          that protect each partner’s core purpose instead of competing with it.

        <p>
          TASK L3C operates as a focused readiness initiative under
          <strong>New Wind Therapeutics L3C</strong>, our parent company.
          New Wind maintains its own primary mission, and TASK exists as a dedicated extension —
          not a replacement — of anyone’s core purpose.

            <p>
              <strong>Carl H. Williams</strong> is a retired U.S. Air Force Master Sergeant
              and former IBM Disaster Recovery Specialist with decades of experience supporting
              Japan’s disaster response ecosystem.
            </p>
            <p>
              After self‑deploying during the 2011 Tohoku disaster, he helped deliver
              lifesaving programs across Fukushima, Miyagi, and Iwate while working
              alongside local and international NGOs and NPOs to strengthen operations.
            </p>
            <p>
              TASK L3C continues that commitment by building readiness before the next
              major event and by giving global supporters a clear way to stand with Japan’s
              most at‑risk communities.
